		  		<p class="giga unit unit-xs-1 unit-s-1 unit-m-1 unit-l-1"> FIFA’s World Cup App was designed as a companion app for the tournament which took place in 2014 in Brazil. By the mid-point of the games, “more than 2.5 billion screen views had been consumed, with fans spending an average of 54 minutes each interacting with live, editorial and social content. <span class="highlight-4">By the final whistle, the app had become the most downloaded sports event app of all time with over 28 million downloads, #1 in over 200 countries” and the 2014 tournament being acknowledged as the ‘first truly mobile and social World Cup’.</span>”</p>

		  		<p class="giga unit unit-xs-1 unit-s-1 unit-m-1 unit-l-1"> In 2013 I was invited to work on the official app for FIFA alongside Grapple Mobile’s team of fantastic designers, developers, and product managers. A member of a cross-functional team, I was responsible for <span class="highlight-4">leading the high level concept, conducting a deep-dive discovery process, as well as delivery of the main experience of the app for mobile & tablet on iOS and Android.</span></p>

		  		<p class="giga unit unit-xs-1 unit-s-1 unit-m-1 unit-l-1">Together with FIFA we identified three main goals for the app:</p>
				<ol class="giga unit unit-xs-1 unit-s-1 unit-m-1 unit-l-1">
					<li>Users should be <span class="highlight-4">engaged</span> with the app despite stream of games being unavailable in-app. The engagement should happen before, during and after the games.</li>
					<li>The app should be <span class="highlight-4">valuable</span> and enjoyable for both hardcore football fans and people tuning in just for the event.</li>
					<li>App should encourage user’s <span class="highlight-4">perception</span> of FIFA a socially responsible and inclusive brand, highlighting organisation’s social and charitable work around the world</li>
				</ol>
				<!-- <p class="micro opacity-50 unit-xs-1 unit-s-1 unit-m-1 unit-l-1">Other considerations and constraints: a) The app had to be devised using existing APIs from FIFA’s website; b) The app needed to work across multiple OS’s and support older devices as well as 5 languages.</p> -->

		  		<p class="giga unit unit-xs-1 unit-s-1 unit-m-1 unit-l-1"> The team was locked up in a room for a week trying to break the requirements down into a meaningful user experience and high-level concept. The sessions were organised in way which encouraged collaboration and creative input from all members of the team including managers and developers. I find that doing this allows every department to feel involved and excited about the project, fostering a greater team spirit-which is what often drives the concept through to delivery.</p>

			<p class="giga unit unit-xs-1 unit-s-1 unit-m-1 unit-l-1">After 5 days of creative sessions, we came up with three concepts we wanted to guide this project. We wanted to make sure we have a point of reference later on in delivery that we could look back to to asses priority of features. These were:</p>

				<h3 class="text-upper unit unit-xs-1 unit-s-1 unit-m-1-3-4 unit-l-3-4">Global Stadium</h3>
		  		<p class="giga unit unit-xs-1 unit-s-1 unit-m-1 unit-l-1">Driving engagement with the app without live steaming was the main focus of our sessions. We asked ourselves what else make the tournament the global event it is and how can we make the app useful for people watching the games at home. Our <span class="highlight-4">user research suggested that fans love the conversation happening around the games almost as much as the game itself—with vast majority posting passionately on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram</span>. We expected this behaviour to intensify as the Cup enveloped, coming from both people watching games at home and those experiencing matches at stadiums.</p>
		  		<p class="giga unit unit-xs-1 unit-s-1 unit-m-1 unit-l-1">This sparked <span class="highlight-4">the idea of a Global Stadium-a space in the app where the social content from around the world can be experienced by all users, with smart algorithms highlighting the most relevant content to each fan.</span> The app would prioritise  content by user’s preference, favourite teams and country of origin, putting focus on the social content arriving from the actual stadiums and exclusive behind the stage official footage to allow people watching at home feel as close as possible to actually being there.</p>
		  		<div class="section2"></div>
		  		<figcaption class="img-caption opacity-50 micro">The second screen experience had to be understood and work well from the very first interaction with the app. We realised that for majority of users that would be during the Live Draw, which coincided with app’s initial launch. <span class="">Live Draw experience the app was to replicate and guide thorough the experience on screen helping understand the impact of each draw to the fans.</span></figcaption>
		  		<div class="section2"></div>
		  		<figcaption class="img-caption opacity-50 micro">The rewind functionality was crucial not only for fans ability to relieve an a given match but also for the app’s graceful degradation, after the World Cup was over. We made sure the app would remain current, by providing information about the next relevant tournaments and the next World Cup. The 2014 World Cup was to become archived alongside other World Cups of the past, <span class="">allowing fans to relieve the moments of glory.</span></figcaption>

		  		<p class="giga unit unit-xs-1 unit-s-1 unit-m-1 unit-l-1">Another pilar for the app was the idea that we should attempt to recreate the dynamic feel and rich interactions of football games UI such as FIFA by EA Sports and TV sports channels to make the consumption of large amount of information feel fun and an experience in itself for the fans. We looked particularly towards Eurosport and various other American sports channels featuring dramatic animations and airy ambience. <span class="highlight-4">We paid attention to transitions, contextual UI, and used fake blur effect (mind you this was before iOS7) to create a sense of depth and context. Diagonal lines running through the design were a mindful continuation of FIFA’s logo and a reminder of the dynamic nature of sports.</span> We even considered modelling navigation after design elements familiar from the pitch and built a prototype of a hidden game that users could activate with magic gesture (neither ended in the final product).</p>
		  		<p class="giga unit unit-xs-1 unit-s-1 unit-m-1 unit-l-1">We also carefully considered Information Architecture of the countless stats and match updates which helped us design a clean news reader and football database where fans and casual users alike can easily navigate, find and understand the information they encounter. <span class="highlight-4">We also ensured it was easy to your favourite teams and subscribe to match reminders.</span></p>

		  		<p class="giga unit unit-xs-1 unit-s-1 unit-m-1 unit-l-1">Finally we asked ourselves how can we engage people who come to the app for entertainment into an educational piece about FIFA’s work in charity and help craft the perception of the brand as socially responsible and inclusive of everyone. We looked for inspiration to children’s educational iPad apps (one of we which another team has been working on at the same time) and the WWF fantastic environmental iPad app, a winner of Apple’s annual design award in 2013. <span class="highlight-4">We found that the best way to educate a distracted mind is through a compelling interactive, rich storytelling, which we did by creating a series of simple tasks that unlock consecutive pieces of information.</span></p>

		  		<p class="giga unit unit-xs-1 unit-s-1 unit-m-1 unit-l-1">Another way of making everyone feel one with the global brand was through a design that worked across platforms and in all the supported languages without a compromise to the experience. This meant making sure that no user felt second-best because they have an older device or poor internet connection.</p>

		  		<p class="giga unit unit-xs-1 unit-s-1 unit-m-1 unit-l-1">At the time the app launched and World Cup officially kicked off, I was celebrating my 30th birthday in Iceland. Watching the Live Draw with the FIFA companion app on my lap, I forgot all the sleepless nights and effort that when into this project, and simply enjoyed the fact the app was now available for all to download. <span class="highlight-4">The app reach number 1 in 200 countries, generated over 2 billion screen views and 28 million downloads generating favourable reception from the fans and design community.</span></p>

		  		<p class="giga unit unit-xs-1 unit-s-1 unit-m-1 unit-l-1">It’s now 3 years since we were commissioned to work on this project. While I still feel this is one of best projects I’ve worked on to date, I can’t help but scrutinise some of the decisions we made. In particular, if given a chance, I would refine the use of iconography and redesign main navigation to help drive traffic to all the sections of the app. I would also give more attention to the notifications strategy which I feel has become a platform in itself for modern brands. Looking forward to the next version of the app for the 2018 World Cup in Russia.</p>
