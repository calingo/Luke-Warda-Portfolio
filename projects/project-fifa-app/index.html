					<li><span class="highlight-4">Users should be engaged with the app despite games themselves being unavailable in the app. The engagement should happen before, during and after the games.</span></li>
					<li><span class="highlight-4">Both everyday football fans and people tuning in just for the event should feel that the app is valuable and enjoyable.</span></li>

		  		<p class="giga unit unit-xs-1 unit-s-1 unit-m-1 unit-l-1"> The team collaborated intensely for a week trying to break down the requirements into a meaningful user experience and high-level concept. The sessions were organised in way which encouraged collaboration and creative input from all members of the team&mdash;including managers and developers. This allowed every department to feel involved and excited about the project, fostering a greater team spirit&mdash;which is what often drives the concept through to delivery.</p>

				<h3 class="exa unit unit-xs-1 unit-s-1 unit-m-1-3-4 unit-l-3-4">The world's biggest conversation</h3>
		  		<p class="giga unit unit-xs-1 unit-s-1 unit-m-1 unit-l-1">One of the main concerns of our creative session was the how to drive engagement with the app without live steaming available on the platform. We asked ourselves what else made the tournament exciting and how we could make the app useful for people watching the games at home. Our <span class="highlight-4">research suggested that fans loved the conversation happening around the games almost as much as the game itself—with vast majority posting passionately on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram about their preferred teams</span>. We expected this behaviour to intensify as the Cup enveloped&mdash;from both people watching games at home and those experiencing matches at stadiums.</p>
		  		<figure class="unit unit-xs-1 unit-s-1 unit-m-1 unit-l-1"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/project-fifa-app/tweet-activity.png" class="img-article-width"><figcaption class="img-caption">We assumed that people will be happy to talk about World Cup on social media. The engagement on Twitter turned out to be particularly strong.</figcaption></figure>
		  		<figure class="unit unit-xs-1 unit-s-1 unit-m-1 unit-l-1"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/project-fifa-app/celeb-social-media.jpg" class="img-article-width"><figcaption class="img-caption">We found that people were also very supportive of their teams on Instagram. Apart from official channels, celebrity content had highest impact on the audience.</figcaption></figure>
		  		<h3 class="pad-top exa unit unit-xs-1 unit-s-1 unit-m-1-3-4 unit-l-3-4">The stadium</h3> 
		  		<p class="giga unit unit-xs-1 unit-s-1 unit-m-1 unit-l-1">The realisation of vast content generated by users during the games, sparked <span class="highlight-4">the idea of a Global Stadium&mdash;a space in the app where the social content from around the world can be experienced by all users, with smart algorithms highlighting the most relevant content to each fan.</span> The app would prioritise content by user’s preference, favourite teams and country of origin, putting focus on the content arriving from the actual stadiums and exclusive behind-the-stage official footage to allow people watching at home feel as close as possible to actually being there.</p>

		  		<figure class="unit unit-xs-1 unit-s-1 unit-m-1 unit-l-1"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/project-fifa-app/global-stadium-img-1.png" class="img-article-width"><figcaption class="img-caption">We experimented with ways of framing the social content but it was the concept of a global stadium that stuck the chord with the team most.</figcaption></figure>

		  		<figure class="unit unit-xs-1 unit-s-1 unit-m-1 unit-l-1"><img src="http://i.giphy.com/xT0GqDMLjVDCwdeyFG.gif" class="img-article-width"><figcaption class="img-caption">The stadium would also present in a dynamic manner FIFA's rich official content, including game stats, photos and video clips.</figcaption></figure>
		  		<h3 class="pad-top exa unit unit-xs-1 unit-s-1 unit-m-1-3-4 unit-l-3-4">Live draw</h3> 
		  		<p class="giga unit unit-xs-1 unit-s-1 unit-m-1 unit-l-1">The majority of users would interact with the app during the Live Draw, which coincided with app’s initial launch. We wanted to ensure that the app's value as second screen was clear for this occasion. <span class="">We put effort in making the Live Draw experience in the app replicate the physical draw and help users understand the impact of each result as those came in.</span></p>
		  		<figure class="unit unit-xs-1 unit-s-1 unit-m-1 unit-l-1"><img src="http://i.giphy.com/3o72F74VzOUsqyC2dy.gif" class="img-article-width"><figcaption class="img-caption">Wireframes of the pre-Draw, the Live Draw and the post-Draw experience.</span></figcaption></figure>
		  		<h3 class="pad-top exa unit unit-xs-1 unit-s-1 unit-m-1-3-4 unit-l-3-4">Rewind</h3>
				<p class="giga unit unit-xs-1 unit-s-1 unit-m-1 unit-l-1">The rewind functionality was crucial not only for fans ability to relieve an a given match, but also for the app’s graceful degradation, after the World Cup was over. We made sure the app would remain current, by providing information about the next relevant tournaments and the next World Cup. The 2014 World Cup was to become archived alongside other World Cups of the past, <span class="">allowing fans to relieve the moments of glory.</span></p>

		  		<p class="giga unit unit-xs-1 unit-s-1 unit-m-1 unit-l-1">Another theme supporting the app's concept was recreating a dynamic feel and rich interactions of football games such as FIFA by EA Sports as well as sports TV channels to make the consumption of large amount of information feel fun and entertaining. We looked particularly towards various  American sports channels featuring dramatic animations and airy ambiance.</p>

		  		<p class="giga unit unit-xs-1 unit-s-1 unit-m-1 unit-l-1"><span class="highlight-4">We paid attention to transitions, contextual UI, and used fake blur effect (mind you this was before iOS7) to create a sense of depth and context. Diagonal lines running through the design were a mindful continuation of FIFA’s logo and a reminder of the dynamic nature of sports.</span> We considered modeling core navigation after elements familiar from football pitch. We also built a prototype of a hidden game that users could activate with magic gesture (only to discard it later).</p>

		  		<p class="giga unit unit-xs-1 unit-s-1 unit-m-1 unit-l-1">Finally, we asked ourselves how can we introduce people who come to the app for entertainment to an educational piece about FIFA’s charity work. We needed to craft the perception of the brand as socially responsible and inclusive of everyone. Looking at top children’s educational apps, <span class="highlight-4">we figured that the best way to teach a distracted mind is through a compelling interactive storytelling. We aimed to achieve that by building an Explore section with a series of stories containing simple tasks that unlock consecutive pieces of information.</span></p>

		  		<p class="giga unit unit-xs-1 unit-s-1 unit-m-1 unit-l-1">Another way of making everyone feel one with the global brand was through a design that worked across platforms and in all the supported languages without a compromise to the experience. This meant making sure that no user felt second-best because they have an older device or poor internet connection. Additionally we optimised the app for accessibility and vision impairment.</p>

Watching the Live Draw with the FIFA companion app on my lap, I fondly revisited the excitement of my first day on this project. I was now ecstatic to see that the app was finally available for everyone to download. <span class="highlight-4">Soon after the app reach number 1 in 200 countries, generated over 2 billion screen views and 28 million downloads generating favourable reception from the fans and design community.</span></p>

				<p class="giga unit unit-xs-1 unit-s-1 unit-m-1 unit-l-1">In 2014 the app won a <a href="http://footballbusinessawards.com/2014-review/" class="bold">Football Business Award</a> for Most Innovative Use of Technology: “The success of the Global Stadium during the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil forever changed the way in which worldwide sporting events are digitally consumed. Billions of fans also enjoyed the World Cup from the comfort of their own homes, at work, on the move. Truly groundbreaking.“</p>
				<p class="giga unit unit-xs-1 unit-s-1 unit-m-1 unit-l-1">In 2015 the app was a runner up for a <a href="http://webbyawards.com/winners/2015/mobile-sites-apps/handheld-devices/sports-handheld-devices/fifa-app/" class="bold">WEBBY Award</a> for Best Mobile Sites & Apps.</p>

The imagery, the formatting, the type, the transitions, the icons; it’s all pretty...It compares very favourably with (is better than) other ‘match centre’ apps such as Sky Sports, but offers lots of other content, too, notably news, World Cup content, FIFA rankings and interactive games.“</p>

		  		<p class="giga unit unit-xs-1 unit-s-1 unit-m-1 unit-l-1">It’s now 3 years since we were commissioned to work on this project. While I still feel this is one of best projects I’ve worked on to date, I can’t help but scrutinise some of the decisions we made. In particular&mdash;given a chance&mdash;I would refine the use of iconography and redesign the main navigation to help drive traffic to all the sections of the app. I would also give more attention to the notifications strategy which I feel are becoming a platform in their own right.</p>
